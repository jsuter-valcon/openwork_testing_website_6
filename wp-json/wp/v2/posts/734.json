Mortgage lenders, the FCA, the Government as well as organisations such as UK Finance and the Building Societies Association have come together to provide you with a new Charter to give you reassurance and support through these tough times. They are committed to implementing this new Charter as soon as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenders have an extensive range of measures they have agreed to, to help you if you\u2019re finding it difficult. Lenders don\u2019t want to repossess your home; repossession is either a last resort or when it is in your financial interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Under the new Charter, lenders\u2019 promises include:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Helping and guiding you if you\u2019re worried about your mortgage repayments without it affecting your credit file.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supporting you in switching to a new mortgage deal at the end of your existing fixed rate without needing another affordability check, if you\u2019re up to up to date with payments.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Providing timely information to help you plan if you\u2019re approaching the end of your current deal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offering you tailored support if you\u2019re struggling, such as extending your term to reduce your payments, with the option to go back to your original term within six months. A range of other options are available depending on your circumstances such as switching to interest-only payments for six months, temporary payment deferral or part interest, part repayment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You won\u2019t be forced to leave your home without your consent, within a year from your first missed payment, and only in exceptional circumstances.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>From 10 July, if you\u2019re approaching the end of a fixed rate deal, you will have the option to secure a new deal up to six months ahead. You can also request a better like-for-like deal that\u2019s available with your lender up until your new term starts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We are here to help you with any mortgage payment concerns you have. If you are currently in arrears, our advisers can work with your lender to get the support you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YOUR HOME MAY BE REPOSSESSED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON YOUR MORTGAGE.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approved by The Openwork Partnership on 06\/07\/2023<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expiry 06\/01\/2024 \/ Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@yamnez?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Gautier Salles<\/a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/_NAwOXcyxFk?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u00a9 Openwork Ltd 2023<\/strong> <strong>WRITTEN BY ESTELLE HARTLEY-MCDONALD<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New Mortgage Charter encourages lenders to provide you with more support Banks and Building Societies have been encouraged by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to offer more flexibility if you are finding it difficult to make mortgage payments.
