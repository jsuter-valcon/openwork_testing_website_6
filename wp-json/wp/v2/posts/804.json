So if you are one of the thousands coming to the end of your fixed rate deal over the next few months it\u2019s very likely you\u2019ll see your payments increase as a result of higher mortgage rates but it\u2019s a common misunderstanding that the Bank of England base rate is directly linked to the mortgage rates on offer. There are many factors that determine mortgage rate pricing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lots of factors determine mortgage pricing \u2013 not just interest rates<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the base-rate hasn\u2019t changed, we have seen interest rates steadily increasing and it\u2019s likely you will have noticed that mortgage lenders have been decreasing their rates slightly. This is because mortgage lenders use a number of factors to determine mortgage rates and one of these is something called \u2018swap rates\u2019 which lenders use to reflect expectations for future interest rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consequently, many mortgage lenders have already priced the latest base-rate increases or non-movement into their rates so the impact on new mortgage deals is likely to be minimal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, after the UK annual rate of inflation reached 11.1% in October 2022, a 41-year high, it has been falling ever since and this gives banks and building societies more confidence that interest rates could fall in the longer term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We can help you navigate the mortgage market<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to remortgage, we can help you navigate the mortgage market effectively.
