Despite the recent Bank of England base rate rise, rates on cash accounts remain below inflation while the FTSE-100 gained 14.3% last year \u2013 its best performance for five years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excess savings in the UK \u2013 the extra amount people have saved because of restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 is estimated to be around \u00a3163 billion compared with \u00a3112 billion a year ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just 15% of those questioned said they had a healthy balance between savings and investments while 14% said they were willing to miss out on higher returns by avoiding stock market investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One potential reason for avoiding the stock market highlighted by the research was lack of knowledge \u2013 around 11% said they did not know where to go for advice. However, nearly one in 10 (9%) said they had benefited from financial advice in terms of higher returns on their cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Claire Limon, Network Director at The Openwork Partnership<\/strong><strong>, said:&nbsp;<\/strong>\u201cIt is good news that people have built up savings and the money will be very valuable given the looming rises in the cost of living.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut there is a real risk of reckless caution costing people substantial amounts from ignoring stock market investment in favour of keeping money in cash when rates remain at very low levels \u2013 meaning savers are losing money after inflation is taken into account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt is understandable that people are worried about the risks of losing money on the stock market but advice from a professional adviser can help ensure their money works hard for them and any investments are tailored to their appetite for risk<strong>.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The table below shows the picture across the country with people in Wales most worried about investing in the stock market and most likely to want to keep all their money in cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>REGION<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>HOW MANY ARE WORRIED ABOUT INVESTING IN THE STOCK MARKET<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>HOW MANY PREFER TO KEEP ALL THEIR MONEY IN CASH<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Wales<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>37%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>32%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>London<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>30%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>21%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>South West<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>29%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>21%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Northern Ireland<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>28%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>17%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>West Midlands<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>26%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>16%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>East of England<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>26%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>18%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Scotland<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>25%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>22%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>North West<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>25%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>27%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>South East<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>25%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>21%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Yorkshire &amp; The Humber<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>22%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>21%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>North East<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>21%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>23%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>East Midlands<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>20%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>29%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>UK<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>26%<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>22%<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WRITTEN BY KIRSTY TELLING<\/strong> \/ Photo by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@sdmk?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Severin Demchuk<\/a>\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/sky-diving?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/XrzLWellnd0\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/opSaoYEG-Qw\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@sdmk\"><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New research from The Openwork Partnership, one of the UK\u2019s largest and longest established financial advice and investment networks, shows more than 11.6 million are keeping all their money in cash despite ongoing low rates.
