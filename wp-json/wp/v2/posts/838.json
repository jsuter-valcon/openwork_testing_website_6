We\u2019ve put together a checklist to ensure you\u2019re aware of all the ways to make sure you don\u2019t miss out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Open or top up your ISA<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can hold up to \u00a320,000 in your ISA in the 2023\/2024 tax year and split the contribution, between either a Cash ISA or Stocks and Shares ISA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Use your pension allowance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually if you\u2019re under 75 can contribute to a pension and receive income tax relief, up to 45%. You can contribute your total salary or \u00a360,000, whichever is the lesser amount, down to \u00a33,600.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Review your State Pension National Insurance contributions<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of State Pension you\u2019ll get depends on how many \u2018qualifying\u2019 years of National Insurance payments you have. Review your National Insurance contributions that you pay when you are working and see if you can top it up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Open or top up a Junior ISA<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can add up to \u00a39,000 into a Junior ISA in the 2023\/2024 tax year, until the child turns 18. Like normal ISAs, you can choose between a Cash ISA or Stocks &amp; Shares.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. The capital gains tax allowance is \u00a36,000 for the 2023\/2024 tax year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means if you make gains on assets over the value of \u00a36,000 annually, you\u2019ll be required to pay capital gains tax on the excess amount at their marginal tax rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Match Capital Gains and Losses in the same tax year to reduce CGT liability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Capital gains and losses incurred in the same tax year are offset against each other. This includes reducing gains down to zero even though some of the gain would otherwise have been covered by the annual exemption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Consider VCTs and EISs<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VCTs are sophisticated, long-term investments offering the chance to invest in small, fast growing UK companies. In return for the extra risk, you can receive a tax relief of up to 30%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment. You may not be able to access your money easily and are unlikely to be protected if something goes wrong.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. Reduce your Inheritance Tax liability<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can gift up to \u00a33,000, known as the annual allowance, and use previous unused annual allowance once. Gifts over \u00a33,000 are known as Potentially Exempt Transfers (PET) and free of inheritance tax if the individual survives seven years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning now allows you to make smart decisions throughout the year that will benefit you and your family\u2019s financial future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WRITTEN BY SARA BERRO \/ 13TH FEBRUARY 2024<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@chrislinnett?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Chris Linnett<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/a-field-full-of-purple-and-white-flowers-lrNyNufp-74?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we approach the end of the tax year, it&#8217;s a good time to start thinking about how to make the most of the tax reliefs and allowances you\u2019re entitled to, before they are lost.
