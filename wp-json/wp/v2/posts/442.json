It\u2019s proved popular since launch in 2013, with almost 300,000 properties bought as part of the initiative so far. But some aspects of the scheme are changing later this year, and it\u2019s important you understand whether you\u2019ll still be eligible for help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are you eligible?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Help to Buy equity loan rules apply from April 2021 to March 2023. To qualify, you must:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>be a first-time buyer in England;<\/li><li>have a deposit worth at least 5% of the property you\u2019re looking to buy;<\/li><li>borrow a minimum of 5% and up to a maximum of 20% (40% in London) of the full purchase price of a new-build home from the government; and<\/li><li>buy the property from a homebuilder registered with the scheme.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the price caps?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of your home can\u2019t exceed the maximum figure outlined by the government. These limits vary depending on where you\u2019re looking to buy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Region<\/td><td>Maximum property price<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>North East<\/td><td>\u00a3186,100<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>North West<\/td><td>\u00a3224,400<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Yorkshire and the Humber<\/td><td>\u00a3228,100<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>East Midlands<\/td><td>\u00a3261,900<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>West Midlands<\/td><td>\u00a3255,600<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>East of England<\/td><td>\u00a3407,400<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>London<\/td><td>\u00a3600,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South East<\/td><td>\u00a3437,600<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South West<\/td><td>\u00a3349,000<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The total cost of buying your home will be covered by the government equity loan as well as your deposit and mortgage. The percentage you borrow from the government is based on the market value of your home when you buy it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if the property is worth \u00a3200,000, you might ask the government for a 20% equity loan (\u00a340,000) to add to your 5% deposit (\u00a310,000) and 75% mortgage (\u00a3150,000).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loan is interest free for the first five years, and from the sixth year you\u2019ll be charged interest at 1.75% each month. This rate increases every year after that in line with the consumer price index, plus 2%. You\u2019ll continue to pay interest until you\u2019ve fully repaid the loan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can repay all or part of the equity loan at any time, but a part payment must be a least 10% of what your home is worth at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to pay the equity loan back in full if you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>reach the end of the equity loan term<\/li><li>pay off your mortgage<\/li><li>sell your home<\/li><li>do not follow the terms set out in the equity loan contract<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What if the value of my home changes?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount you have to pay back is based on the market value of the property when you choose to repay. If the market value of your home rises, so does the amount you owe on your equity loan \u2013 if it falls, the amount you owe also falls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rest assured we are here to help if you have any questions about Help to Buy mortgages<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>YOUR HOME MAY BE REPOSSESSED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON YOUR MORTGAGE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WRITTEN BY KIRSTY TELLING \/ 21ST APRIL 2021<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@insideweather?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Inside Weather<\/a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/home?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get on the property ladder with the Help to Buy scheme All you need to know about upcoming changes to the government\u2019s Help to Buy equity loan scheme.
