It has been found that borrowers on an SVR could save an average of \u00a31,602 a year, that\u2019s over \u00a3133 every month!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sound familiar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with a potentially sizeable saving to be made by remortgaging, it\u2019s surprising how many people just stick with their SVR. Why is that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise my mortgage deal had ended<\/em>\u201d \u2013 your lender should have let you know, but always remember to make a note of the end date of a new mortgage deal so you don\u2019t forget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>My lender contacted me, but I didn\u2019t understand<\/em>\u201d- mortgage jargon can be confusing, but it pays to check out important mortgage correspondence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cIt\u2019s too much hard work to find a new deal\u201d-&nbsp;<\/em>it\u2019s true that the mortgage market can be bewildering as there are so many deals to choose from. That\u2019s where we can get involved \u2013 to help find you a suitable deal. You can then choose what to do with any savings made!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time to remortgage?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to regularly review your mortgage. Particularly now, when mortgage rates are at record low levels, it makes sense to consider your options to see if you can get a more cost-effective mortgage deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are you still covered?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking of changing your mortgage, remember to review your protection policies at the same time \u2013 especially if you don\u2019t already have cover in place, or your circumstances have changed since you last reviewed your cover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To discuss your remortgaging options and to see if you could save money, please get in touch.
