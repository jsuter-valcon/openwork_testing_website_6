So, as your earnings rise, you\u2019ll pay more tax than if these thresholds rose each year in line with inflation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Reduction in the threshold at which individuals pay additional-rate tax<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Hunt reduced the threshold at which additional-rate Income Tax becomes payable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will now pay the 45% rate of tax on any earnings over \u00a3125,140 (it was previously \u00a3150,000). In simple terms, if you earn more than \u00a3150,000, this specific move means you\u2019ll likely pay just over \u00a31,200 a year in additional Income Tax.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You may pay more Dividend Tax and Capital Gains Tax from 2023<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of his plan to increase tax revenue, the chancellor announced reductions to two key tax allowances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dividend Tax<\/em><br>The Dividend Allowance \u2013 the amount you can earn from dividends before you will pay Dividend Tax \u2013 will reduce from \u00a32,000 to \u00a31,000 in 2023, and then to \u00a3500 in 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you receive any income from dividends, it\u2019s likely that you will pay more tax on these dividends from April 2023 onwards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Capital Gains Tax<br><\/em>The Capital Gains Tax (CGT) annual exempt amount will fall from \u00a312,300 to \u00a36,000 in 2023, and to \u00a33,000 in 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that you will only be able to make profits of \u00a36,000 on non-ISA investments (things like company shares or a second home) in the 2023\/24 tax year before CGT becomes due.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your State Pension will rise<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the \u201ctriple lock\u201d, brought in by the coalition government in 2010, the State Pension increases each year by the higher of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The average increase in wages across the UK<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>or 2.5%.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunt announced that he would increase the State Pension in line with September 2022\u2019s inflation rate of 10.1%. So, if you\u2019re in receipt of the State Pension, that means a significant boost to your payments from April 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re on the full, new State Pension, the BBC reports that you will receive \u00a3203.85 a week, up from \u00a3185.15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pension Credit and other benefits will also be uprated in line with inflation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You&#8217;ll likely pay more for energy from April<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Hunt\u2019s initial moves on becoming chancellor was to scale back Liz Truss\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guarantee ensures that, for six months from 1 October 2022, the average household will pay energy bills of around \u00a32,500 a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his speech, Hunt announced that, while support for energy bills will remain in place, it will become less generous from April 2023. The guarantee will rise to \u00a33,000 for a further 12 months, meaning you could well see your gas and electricity bills rise again in the spring \u2013 although the government say their measures would save the typical household \u00a3500 in a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be additional support for more vulnerable households, such as pensioners and those on benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inheritance Tax thresholds frozen until at least 2028<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, qualifying estates can pass on up to \u00a3500,000 with no Inheritance Tax (IHT) liability using the nil-rate and residence nil-rate bands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The qualifying estate of a surviving spouse or civil partner can continue to pass on up to \u00a31 million without an IHT liability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two thresholds had already been frozen until 2026. The chancellor announced an extension to this freeze, meaning that the nil-rate bands will remain at these levels until at least 2028.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As house prices and asset values rise, it will become increasingly likely that the value of your estate exceeds the combined nil-rate bands, and that your family may face an IHT bill on your passing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stamp Duty changes become a &#8216;holiday&#8217;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, Kwasi Kwarteng announced some increases in the thresholds at which Stamp Duty is payable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stamp Duty in England and Northern Ireland is now only paid above \u00a3250,000 while first-time buyers only pay the tax on purchases over \u00a3450,000 (and discounted Stamp Duty on properties up to \u00a3625,000).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these changes will remain, the chancellor said they will now be time-limited, ending on 31 March 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other key announcements at a glance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The largest-ever rise in the UK\u2019s national living wage. For workers aged 23 and over, it will rise by 9.7% to \u00a310.42 an hour from April 2023.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Confirmation that the main rate of Corporation Tax will increase to 25% from April 2023.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The lifetime cap on social care costs in England due to come into force in October 2023 will be delayed by two years.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Electric cars, vans, and motorcycles will begin to pay Vehicle Excise Duty in the same way as petrol and diesel vehicles from April 2025.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Councils will have more flexibility in raising Council Tax without asking voters.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>HS2 and the Northern Powerhouse Rail schemes will continue as planned.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A \u00a313.6 billion package of business rates support over the next five years.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spending of \u00a32.8 billion in 2023\/24 and \u00a34.7 billion in 2024\/25 for adult social care and an additional \u00a33.3 billion in 2023\/24 and a further \u00a33.3 billion in 2024\/25 to improve the performance of the NHS.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A significant increase in windfall taxes. The oil and gas companies&#8217; tax rate will increase from 25% to 35% of profits on UK operations from January 2023 until March 2028, while there will also be a 45% tax on profits of older renewable and nuclear electricity generation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any questions about how the autumn statement could affect you, we can help.
