After paying her monthly bills, she\u2019s always had a bit left over. So, when her mortgage lender wrote to her to remind her that her five-year fixed-rate deal was coming to an end and that she needed to find a new deal or she\u2019d be switched to their standard variable rate (SVR), she simply let them make the switch. She wasn\u2019t worried about money and thought looking for a new deal would be too much hassle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interest rate on an SVR mortgage is set by the bank or building society and they can put it up at any time. It is usually higher than the rate you\u2019d get with a mortgage deal and can significantly increase your monthly payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the cost-of-living crisis starts to bite, times are tight for Sarah. Her energy bills have skyrocketed. Filling up the car costs a fortune. In fact, she seems to be paying more for everything these days, even her TV subscriptions are getting more expensive. She\u2019s struggling to cover her monthly bills but, with interest rates rising, Sarah\u2019s worried she\u2019s missed the boat when it comes to securing a competitive mortgage deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Has Sarah left it too late to switch from her SVR mortgage?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the interest rates on both tracker and fixed-rate deals are creeping up, it still makes sense for Sarah to switch away from her SVR mortgage. According to Moneyfacts, in March 2022 the average SVR was 4.61%, while the average rate on a two-year tracker was 2.03% and on a two-year fixed was 2.65%. This means Sarah should be able to make significant savings by switching. And she\u2019s not the only one who could save money. Research by Habito found 27% of mortgage holders in the UK are currently on their lender\u2019s SVR and they worked out, on an average mortgage, this translates to an extra \u00a3340 a month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How can Sarah make sure she secures the best deal possible?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah would almost certainly benefit from speaking to a qualified mortgage adviser. They understand the market and know where to find the best deals. Sarah may have to pay a penalty to switch from her SVR mortgage. Sometimes, you have to spend a year or more on an SVR before switching without a penalty. A professional will be able to advise Sarah whether it makes sense to wait or to pay any penalty and remortgage straight away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>But Sarah is nervous about speaking to an adviser; she finds mortgages confusing.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mortgages can be complicated but a qualified adviser will be able to explain them simply and answer any questions Sarah has. Mortgage advisers are there to take the effort out of finding the right deal and it\u2019s got to be a lot less stressful than worrying about whether you\u2019re going to be able to pay your bills each month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re on an SVR mortgage or your current deal is coming to an end and you want to avoid being switched to an SVR mortgage, we\u2019ll be happy to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>YOUR HOME MAY BE REPOSSESSED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON YOUR MORTGAGE.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WRITTEN BY ISSY MINTURN<\/strong> \/ Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@danfreemanphoto?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Dan Freeman<\/a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/summer-flowers?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is a Standard Variable Rate Mortgage?
