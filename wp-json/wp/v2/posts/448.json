For many of us, life has felt more uncertain than ever over the past year as we continue to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Although we can\u2019t always control what\u2019s happening in our lives, we can plan for the unexpected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By taking out a protection policy, you can safeguard your family\u2019s finances if your situation changes. The main types of protection include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Life cover \u2013 pays out a lump sum if you die<\/li><li>Health insurance \u2013 pays medical costs at a private hospital or private ward<\/li><li>Critical illness \u2013 pays a tax-free lump sum if you\u2019re diagnosed with a major illness<\/li><li>Home contents and buildings \u2013 covers your home\u2019s structure (including fixtures and fittings) and contents (furniture)<\/li><li>Income \u2013 pays out if you can\u2019t work due to illness or injury<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as peace of mind, protection policies often come with added extras. We\u2019ve highlighted examples of some of the perks you could receive when you take out a policy, even if you don\u2019t make a claim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Welcome gifts<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you sign up for a protection policy, some providers offer a welcome gift. For example, health insurers sometimes offer gadgets like an Apple Watch to help you track your activity \u2013 with some even offering a discount based on the amount of exercise you do each month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Discounts<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many health insurers offer discounts on gym memberships and weight-loss programmes to help you embrace a healthier lifestyle. Some also offer you the option of taking a health check to reduce the amount you pay each month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that when you take out a protection policy, your provider is likely to offer you discounts on other products such as pet or travel insurance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Additional healthcare options<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some health insurers now cover complementary therapies such as osteopathy and acupuncture, giving you more treatment choices. In addition, counselling services are now included in most health insurance policies and many also give you the option to upgrade your hospital room if you need treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Will writing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some providers of life insurance give new policyholders the opportunity to draw up a will free of charge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cover for children<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many critical illness plans include free cover for dependent children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What support do insurers offer after the event?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Illness and bereavement help. Many providers give free access to services offering practical and emotional support for those left behind after the death of the policyholder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rehabilitation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurers usually offer back-to-work support services, including physiotherapy, careers guidance or advice if you choose to go self- employed. If you\u2019re returning to work following a mental health issue, providers will continue to cover counselling sessions for a set period of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever type of protection you\u2019re looking for, get in touch and we can help!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WRITTEN BY KIRSTY TELLING \/ 22ND APRIL 2021<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@breakfast_on_jupiter?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Aleksandr Ledogorov<\/a>\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/peace?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The perks of protection As well as peace of mind, many insurance providers offer additional benefits that you may not know about.
