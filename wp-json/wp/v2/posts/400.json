There are different types and the amount you can place in them without being charged tax (the tax-free allowance) varies. You can spread your money across different types of ISAs, but you can\u2019t exceed the maximum annual allowance of \u00a320,000.

The annual allowance for 2020\/21 is \u00a340,000 and includes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>the total amount paid in to a defined contribution scheme in a tax year by you or anyone else (such as your employer); and<\/li><li>any increase in a defined benefit scheme in a tax year.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be able to carry over your annual allowance from the last three years if you\u2019ve not used all of it. Bear in mind that it may be lower than \u00a340,000 if you have flexible access to your pension pot. You\u2019ll also have a reduced (\u2018tapered\u2019) annual allowance if:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>your \u2018threshold income\u2019 (your net income for the year) is more than \u00a3200,000; or<\/li><li>your \u2018adjusted income\u2019 (which includes the value of all your employer\u2019s pension contributions) is more than \u00a3240,000.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Capital gains tax<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br><\/strong>You\u2019ll have to pay capital gains tax (CGT) on your overall gains if they go above your tax-free allowance \u2013 otherwise known as the annual exempt amount. The CGT annual exempt amount is \u00a312,300, or \u00a36,150 for trusts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also be able to reduce your tax bill by deducting losses or claiming reliefs, but this depends on the asset, so make sure you ask your financial adviser for more information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Inheritance tax<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br><\/strong>The rules surrounding inheritance tax (IHT) are really complicated and it\u2019s important to seek financial advice before making any decisions. For example, you can give away assets or cash worth up to \u00a33,000 a year and there will be no IHT to pay regardless of the total value of your estate when you die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also give as many gifts of up to \u00a3250 to as many people as you want each year \u2013 although not to anyone who has already received a gift of your whole \u00a33,000 annual exemption. To make use of this exemption, it\u2019s important to keep accurate records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about how to make the most of your money this tax year and for more information about your tax-free allowances, speak to your financial adviser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HM Revenue and Customs practice and the law relating to taxation are complex and subject to individual circumstances and changes which cannot be foreseen.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The value of investments and any income from them can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the original amount invested.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WRITTEN BY KIRSTY TELLING \/ 09TH MARCH 2021<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The current tax year ends on 5 April 2021, so now\u2019s a good time to make sure your finances are in order and book an annual review with your financial adviser.
