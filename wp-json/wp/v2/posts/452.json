Holidays were not booked, and the closure of restaurants, bars and entertainment venues cut spending in those areas, resulting in slightly healthier current accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this, the Bank of England estimates, resulted in over \u00a3125 billion saved in 2020. Its survey does note that only a fraction of this is likely to be spent by households, suggesting a cautious approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is understandable given the drop in income for furloughed employees, the loss of income for the unemployed and an unstable job market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to invest your lockdown savings<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving your savings in a high-street bank account won\u2019t build much interest.

Check with your mortgage company about their terms and conditions relating to overpayments.<\/li><li>Build an emergency fund \u2013 this fund should contain enough to cover the essentials for a month (like bills, food and your rent or mortgage payments) if anything were to happen affecting your income. Consider opening a separate bank account \u2014 easily accessible to you \u2014 to store your fund.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start with all of these options is to create a budget that tracks your income every month compared to your spending, allowing you to work out how much you can put aside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our trusted financial advisers are here to help you find the best ways to invest your money to make the most of your savings \u2014 whatever your situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The value of investments and any income from them can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the original amount invested.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WRITTEN BY KIRSTY TELLING \/ 24TH MAY 2021<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@jannerboy62?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Nick Fewings<\/a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/collections\/65770064\/money-?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The pandemic has reportedly created 6 million accidental savers, but what\u2019s the best way to use this extra cash?
