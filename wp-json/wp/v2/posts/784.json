As a parent, your children depend on you financially. But should you become ill or injured and unable to work, would your family be able to manage without your income?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would your family be able to cover all the essential monthly outgoings \u2013 not to mention the extras you\u2019re used to having?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a two-parent family, even with a safety-net of sick pay and savings, you might struggle to keep up with your regular outgoings on one income, especially if you\u2019re not well enough to go back to work for a substantial amount of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial struggle for your family is the last thing you need when you\u2019re trying to recover from a medical condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are you a one-income family?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also worth bearing in mind that becoming a parent may mean you now only have one income if one parent is staying at home for childcare purposes. Protecting this main source of income is essential, as is the case with one-parent families. With the rising cost of childcare and bills, the need to protect your family against financial difficulty is more important than ever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Income protection can give you the support you need, when you need it most.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By protecting your family this way, you can get help with mortgage payments, bills and food, as well as clothes, transport and leisure \u2013 protecting not just your essential outgoings, but your family\u2019s lifestyle too. Putting income protection in place alleviates the risk of financial instability by providing your family with a regular source of income, so you have the peace of mind that your children will be provided for until you get better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find out what works for you with an adviser from Wellspring Financial<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Income protection can be discussed with your adviser \u2013 so you can make sure you have the right protection in place to protect you and your family\u2019s financial future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Call Wellspring Financial on 0191 484 1920 or drop us an email on info@wellspringfinancial.co.uk<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approved by The Openwork Partnership on 03\/07\/2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expiry date \u2013 04\/06\/2024<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a parent, providing for your children is a top priority \u2013 from making sure they have food on the table, to ensuring they have the extras they need in life.
