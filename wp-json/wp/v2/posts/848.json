But psychology can have a much larger effect than you think, and it can lead to you making decisions that aren\u2019t right for you. Read on to find out more about what behavioural finance is and how it could affect you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBehavioural finance\u201d was first coined in the 1970s by economist Robert Shiller and psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. They used the term to refer to how unconscious biases and previous experiences affect the way people make financial decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be used to explain why investors can make knee-jerk decisions or invest in opportunities that aren\u2019t in their own best interest. Rather than relying purely on facts, investors often have biases that affect how they react to certain situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finance bias can lead to \u201cirrational\u201d decisions through shortcuts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a reason why people often make decisions based on biases: they can make the decision-making process quicker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you imagine how many decisions you need to make every single day, it\u2019s easy to see why this kind of decision-making can be useful. From what to eat for breakfast to which way to travel to work, it\u2019d take up all your time if you carefully went through the facts for each decision you make. So, you make shortcuts by using biases. However, while it can be a useful process in your day-to-day life, bias can have a negative effect when you\u2019re making important decisions, including financial ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Behavioural finance covers five concepts:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>1. Mental accounting<br>Mental accounting can be incredibly useful when you\u2019re managing a budget. However, inflexibility could mean you miss out on opportunities. The concept refers to how people may designate money for certain purposes. So, you may have different savings accounts for various goals. It\u2019s a process that can help you manage your outgoings and work towards goals. However, it can also lead to irrational decision making. You may not dip into a savings account that you\u2019ve allocated to buying a new car even when you face an emergency and it\u2019d make sense logically. How you receive the money may also affect how you use it. For instance, you may put off using money that was given as a gift in an emergency because you believe it should be used for something special.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Herd behaviour<br>Herd behaviour is something that\u2019s often seen in investing. When you hear that lots of people are selling certain stocks or buying a specific share, it can be easy to be led by this and follow suit. It can lead to you making decisions that, while possibly right for others, don\u2019t suit you or your circumstances. It\u2019s not just investing where herd behaviour can have an effect. You may be tempted to purchase an item after a friend has or choose a savings account because someone you know has.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Anchoring<br>When you have some information, you may focus on this \u2013 anchoring your views to this data. Setting a benchmark can be useful, but it can mean you don\u2019t take in other information, especially if it\u2019s contradictory. So, you may hold on to investments even after the value has fallen because you\u2019ve anchored its worth to a previous valuation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Emotional gap<br>Emotions often play a role in financial decisions. You may sell a stock because you fear that the price will fall, or make an impulse purchase because you\u2019re happy. Being comfortable with your financial plan is important, but an emotional gap can fuel irrational decisions as you\u2019re more likely to overlook data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Self-attribution<br>This concept refers to how investors are likely to have overconfidence in their abilities. You may believe you can reliably time the market to maximise profits when the markets are unpredictable. In this case, it\u2019s common to see \u201cwins\u201d as being down to your knowledge, while \u201closses\u201d are attributed to things<br>outside of your control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unconscious bias may affect your decisions in ways you don\u2019t expect.
