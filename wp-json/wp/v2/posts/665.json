Whilst you may have to pay a penalty to leave your lender, especially during the tracker period, there are tracker products that have no early repayment charge, so you are free to leave without penalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re coming up to the end of your fixed-rate and you\u2019re faced with a higher interest rate than you were expecting, switching to a tracker at a lower rate may be tempting. Although you may find there are cheaper tracker products on offer than current fixed rates, you must be confident that you\u2019ll be able to afford your repayments if the rate goes up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can help guide you through all your mortgage options including advice on whether a fixed rate or tracker product is more suitable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>YOUR HOME MAY BE REPOSSESSED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON YOUR MORTGAGE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Approved by The Openwork Partnership on 27\/03\/2023<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@srinis_photography?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Srinis Photography<\/a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/LarOjk975DU?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/oO22ejNFxMA\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/H-yOwW9F8Kk\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@srinis_photography\"><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With over&nbsp;10 years of record low interest rates, fixed rate mortgages offer borrowers the stability of knowing what the mortgage payment will be for a set period, which helps with budgeting.
