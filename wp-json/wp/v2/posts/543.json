A quick Google search will throw up hundreds of random tips \u2013 like using cola to clean the toilet, lemon to clean the taps and vinegar to clean just about anything!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019ve finished scrubbing your worktops with baking soda and polishing your windows with newspapers, why not try spring-cleaning your finances? Here are some handy hints to get you started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Throw away unnecessary spending habits<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at your bank statements for the last couple of months for a snapshot of your finances. It can help highlight any problem spending areas and where you can potentially make savings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have countless direct debits or standing orders? Is there anything you\u2019ve signed up for that you no longer use? Those small payments going out every month can really add up! If you have credits cards make sure you pay them off in full each month, or if not see if you can shift your debts to a lower interest credit card or loan. Just to give yourself space to gradually pay it off without incurring huge amounts of interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Invest in a ISA<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An Individual Savings Account (ISA) is a tax-efficient way of saving. In the current tax year (April 2022 to April 2023) the government allows us to put up to \u00a320K into an ISA. Make sure you take advantage of this before the tax year ends in April 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can save your money in a Cash ISA or Stocks and Shares ISA or split the allowance across both types. A Cash ISA you don\u2019t pay tax on the interest you make on these savings. With a Stocks and Shares ISA means you don\u2019t pay tax on any income or capital gains you\u2019ve made on your investments &#8211; but obviously this involves more risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few other things to bear in mind. The tax efficiency of ISAs is based on current rules. The current tax situation may not be maintained. And of course, the benefit of the tax treatment depends on individual circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Stocks and Shares ISAs, although there is no fixed term you should consider them as a medium to long term investment, of ideally five years or more. And remember, the value of your Stocks and Shares ISA and any income from it may fall as well as rise. You may get back less than you invest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spring clean your protection<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring-cleaning your protection insurance is also important as you\u2019ll want to make sure you have the right cover for your family and your lifestyle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re renting a property you will want to protect your belongings with home contents insurance. If you have just bought a home, you\u2019ll need to make sure both your building and possessions are adequately covered. You should also think about accidental damage cover or home emergency cover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have others who depend on your income, consider taking out cover to provide financial security for them should you become ill or die. Life insurance and critical illness insurance may give you the peace-of-mind that you or your family could cope should the worst happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Set yourself a budget<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started, use your bank statements to analyse your spending patterns and tally up your typical monthly outgoings. Compare this to your monthly income and you can quickly see what\u2019s left (or not) by the end of the month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve done this you can set yourself a budget based on accurate figures. Keep it realistic as you\u2019re more likely to stick to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Check on your mortgage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve got a tracker, fixed or discount rate mortgage, make sure you know when it ends as you\u2019ll likely be switched to your providers Standard Variable Rate (SVR). The SVR is usually higher than the amount you\u2019ve been paying and when interest rates change, so can your monthly payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s worth finding out what alternative products your current mortgage provider offers before checking out the rest of the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get trusted advice<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussing your finances with an expert can make managing your finances simpler.
