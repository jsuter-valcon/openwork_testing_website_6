But we also know it\u2019s not always that easy to find the spare cash required to do so, especially amid a global pandemic.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research studies, though, typically show that many retirees wish they\u2019d saved on a more consistent basis and managed to accumulate a larger nest egg. Mike is one of those people who entered retirement harbouring financial regrets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plan? What plan&#8230;?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last January, after working for over 45 years, Mike decided it was finally time to retire. But he soon hit a snag; Mike simply hadn\u2019t thought enough about the detail of how he would finance his retirement. Although he knew the State Pension wasn\u2019t huge, he hadn\u2019t realised just how difficult it would be to make ends meet and found it quite a shock when reality hit home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Mike isn\u2019t alone. Research suggests more than a third of over 50s either leave their retirement financial plans until the two years before retirement or don\u2019t plan at all. As a result, many retirees are ill-prepared for what\u2019s to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Funding retirement<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people save for their retirement through a pension. Encouragingly, the introduction of auto enrolment has resulted in a rising proportion of the workforce having access to a pension with research highlighting almost three in four workers are now offered a retirement plan by their employer. Worryingly, though, the self-employed largely seem to be neglecting their retirement needs, with just 16% currently saving in a private pension.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An alternative strategy is to use other investments, such as ISAs. These also offer a tax-efficient savings route and can provide greater flexibility than a pension. There is also a specific type of ISA \u2013 Lifetime ISA \u2013 that 18 to 39-year-olds can use to accumulate retirement funds. Bricks and mortar can also be a valuable source of retirement income, either by investing in buy-to-let property or unlocking wealth tied up in a family home by downsizing or through equity release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advice is key<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many people, Mike regrets not saving more across his working life and has two pieces of advice for younger generations: start planning your retirement in plenty of time and seek expert guidance on how to best organise your retirement finances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retirement should be something we all look forward to and enjoy but, to do so, it\u2019s vital to plan ahead.

Just get in touch if you need our expertise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An ISA is a medium to long term investment, which aims to increase the value of the money you invest for growth or income or both.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The value of your investments and any income from them can fall as well as rise. You may not get back the amount you invested<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance and should not be relied upon<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator aligncenter is-style-wide\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>WRITTEN BY KIRSTY TELLING \/ 11TH JANUARY 2021<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all know we need to save for retirement, don\u2019t we?
